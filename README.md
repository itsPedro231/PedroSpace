This website was created as a project to delve into the realms of JavaScript and React. During the development process, I discovered that front-end development is far more engaging than I initially anticipated. The back-end was constructed using Django and its Rest Framework, providing me with insights into the intricacies of communication between various front-end and back-end technologies.

Tech used: Javascript | React | Vite | Python | Django | Docker
